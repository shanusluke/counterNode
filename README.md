# counterNode

## Description

Counter is a project that uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), worker threads, Express, and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to add a count value to a database. It demonstrates the use of worker threads in a Node.js application to perform CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the main thread. 

## Installation

First, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed on your machine. Once you have those, you can clone the project and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shanusluke1999/counterNode.git
cd Counter
npm install
```

or Install the express and pg packages individually:

```bash
npm install express
```
```bash
npm install pg
```

# Usage

To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```
